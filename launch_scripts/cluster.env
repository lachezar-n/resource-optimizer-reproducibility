# Provide optionally a (signle) security group id to be added as additional to the master node
# If value empy the option won't be used and AWS won't attach an additional group and the SSH may be blocked
# Multiple additional groups are not supported by the launch script and this one is attached to the master only

# Execution specific -------------------------

# (number) - if 0 the cluster will be terminated automatically after program execution
# - if greater than 0 the cluster will be terminated automatically after the given number of second in state idle
# - if less than 0 no automatic temrination rules will be applied
